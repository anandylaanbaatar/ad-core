        <h3 class="mb-2">Use of information</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We generally process Personal Information that we collect to fulfil
          our contractual obligations to you, in furtherance of our legitimate
          interests in operating the Services and our business and where you
          have consented to such usage. We may also process your Personal
          Information to comply with a legal obligation, namely regarding fraud
          prevention.
          <br /><br />
          If your data is being processed based on your consent, you may
          withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent will not
          affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent that
          {{ companyName }}
          carried out before the withdrawal.
          <br /><br />
          More specifically, {{ companyName }} processes your Personal
          Information: <br /><br />
          01. To provide, update, maintain, protect, improve, and customize the
          Services and our business. This includes processing of Personal
          Information to support delivery of the Services, transaction
          processing, prevent or address service errors, security or technical
          issues, analyze and monitor usage, trends and other activities or at
          your request.
          <br /><br />
          02. {{ companyName }} may use your email address or phone number to
          send you notices (including any notices required by law, in lieu of
          communication by postal mail). If you correspond with
          {{ companyName }} by email, we may retain the content of your email
          messages, your email address and our responses. <br /><br />
          03. To personalize your experience, when you register an account or
          complete a transaction. This includes Personal Information to
          understand your buying/shopping preferences so that we may be able to
          advertise other products that you might be interested, to notify you
          of items left as uncompleted transactions in your shopping cart, and
          related communications. {{ companyName }} has a legitimate interest in
          collecting and using your email and information about your abandoned
          shopping cart to communicate with you about your uncompleted
          transaction. <br /><br />
          04. To improve customer service. Your information enables us to more
          effectively respond to your customer service requests and support
          needs.
          <br /><br />

          marketing communications, including offers, discounts, when you have
          consented to it.
          <br /><br />

          <br /><br />
          <span class="font3">Transfer of Personal Information</span>
          <br /><br />
          For providing you our Services, we may transfer and share your
          Personal Information to other entities of {{ companyName }}’s group
          and to third parties that may be located in other countries. Namely,
          we use service providers and intermediaries, such as companies that
          provide technological support and electronic payment processing
          companies, which must have access to some of your Personal
          Information, including but not limited to purposes of transaction
          processing and fraud prevention. <br /><br />
          However, these transfers are made solely and exclusively for the
          fulfillment of the purposes for which your Personal Information is
          collected and in accordance with our instructions, in strict
          compliance with the regulations on the processing of personal data and
          information security.
          <br /><br />
          We may also communicate your personal data to third parties where:
          <br />
          • You have expressly consented to it; or <br />
          • The communication is made in order to comply with a legal obligation
          or a court order.
          <br /><br />
          All transfers of your Personal Information to third parties located
          outside the European Union or the European Economic Area (i.e. to a
          third country) shall be made ensuring strict compliance with European
          legislation on the transfer of data to third countries and with all
          necessary information, including an indication of the safeguards for
          such transfer:<br />
          • Adequacy decisions: where the European Commission determines that a
          third country offers an adequate level of data protection, personal
          data may be sent to that country without implementing any other
          measures mentioned above;<br />
          • Standard contractual clauses: we use standard contractual clauses
          for the transfer of personal data to organizations outside the EEA.
          These contractual commitments have been adopted by the European
          Commission and ensure adequate protection of personal data transferred
          to countries outside the EEA by binding recipients of personal data to
          certain data protection standards, including the obligation to
          implement appropriate technical and security measures; • Other
          contractual commitments: comparable to those provided in the standard
          contractual clauses.
          <br /><br />
          <span class="font3">Storage of Personal Information</span>
          <br /><br />
          Your Personal Information will only be kept for the period of time
          necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected or for
          the periods of time required by law.
          <br /><br />
          Purchase and billing data will be kept during the execution of the
          purchase and sale agreement and, after its termination, it may still
          be kept for a reasonable period, if you decide to use our Services
          again or to comply with our legal obligations, particularly those of a
          tax nature.
