            Customers may join {{ companyName }}’s Loyalty Rewards Program, by
            registering in our Site, in the ‘Create an Account’ section. In
            order to complete the registration, Customer must provide their name
            and email and create a password. Joining the Loyalty Rewards Program
            is free. By joining the Loyalty Rewards Program, the Customer must
            consent to receive promotional, advertising, and other emails from
            {{ companyName }}.<br /><br />
            The creation of an {{ companyName }} Account streamlines the
            procedure for placing orders and completing a purchase.<br /><br />
            By registering in our Site, Customer warrants that all information
            is correct and updated. By creating an account, the Customer
            expressly accepts these Terms & Conditions and our Privacy
            Policy.<br /><br />
            {{ companyName }} reserves the right to suspend or eliminate a

            <span class="font3">1. How to Earn</span>
            <br /><br />
            By adhering to the Loyalty Rewards Program, the Customer will earn
            points:<br />
            · With each purchase made on our Site;<br />
            · By engaging with {{ companyName }}’s brand and community
            online;<br />
            · Through seasonal sales;<br />
            · By referring friends;<br />
            · By reviewing products purchased by you.<br /><br />
            Currently, the Loyalty Rewards Program is exclusive to our Site.
            Thus, it is not possible to earn or redeem points for purchases made
            in our physical stores.<br /><br />
            All purchases made by the Customer before joining the Loyalty
            Rewards Program will not be considered for earning points.<br /><br />
            All points are valid for 12 months, after which they expire and may
            no longer be redeemed.<br /><br />
            <span class="font3">2. How to Redeem Points</span>
            <br /><br />
            To redeem points, the Customer must be logged in our Site with the
            email used during registration in the Loyalty Rewards Program. It is
            not possible to combine points, rewards or offers from various
            accounts, even if the account holder name is the same Customer.<br /><br />
            You can redeem your points during checkout, before finalizing the
            order, by clicking the dropdown menu bar to select the number of
            points you would like to redeem on the order.<br /><br />
            A minimum balance of at least 100 points ($10) is necessary each
            time the Customer wants to make a redemption. Points can be redeemed
            in increments of 100 points ($10).<br /><br />
            If you were not logged in when placing an order, you may contact us
            at
            {{ email }} to help apply your points to your Loyalty Rewards
            Program account. If you’re a returning Customer and you did a guest
            checkout by mistake but used the same email address associated with
            your Loyalty Rewards Program account, you will still earn points for
            that purchase.<br /><br />
            <span class="font3">3. Points Balance in Case of Returns</span>
            <br /><br />
            Any points you earn on a purchase that you later return will be
            deducted from your point balance.<br /><br />
            If you used your reward points to place an order and are returning
            the entire order, we will refund you the total dollar amount spent
            after the discount was applied. The points you redeemed will also be
            added back to your Loyalty Rewards Program account. New points
            earned from the refunded purchase will be removed from your Loyalty
            Rewards Program account.<br /><br />
            If you used your reward points to place an order and are returning
            only a part of that order, we will refund you the total dollar
            amount for the product(s) you are returning, but the reward points
            that you redeemed for that order will not be added back to your
            Loyalty Rewards Program account. In this case, the number of new
            points earned will equal the amount left after the partial refund.
            For example, if you spent $100 and were refunded $80, you will earn
            20 points.<br /><br />
            you will not receive any points in case your purchase is canceled
            for any reason.<br /><br />
            <span class="font3">4. Other Benefits</span>
            <br /><br />
            If you add your birthday on the Loyalty Rewards Program page, we
            will send you a discount code to your email, which will be valid for
            30 days from the date of your birthday. If, at the time of entering
            your birthday to your account, your birthday is within 30 days, the
            discount code reward will be delayed 30 days from the date of
            entry.<br /><br />
            The birthday discount code is non-transferable and must not be sold
            or assigned to third persons.<br /><br />
            <span class="font3">5. Friends Referral</span>
            <br /><br />
            You may earn points by referring a friend, if the following
            conditions are met:<br /><br />
            · Referred friends must be first-time customers in order for both of
            you to receive the referral rewards;<br />
            · The referral must be initiated through the use of your unique
            referral link, sent by {{ companyName }}.<br /><br />
            Points will be added to your Loyalty Rewards Program account as soon
            as your friend completes their first purchase on our website.<br /><br />
            If you referred any friends but did not receive any points for it,
            please confirm whether all above mentioned requirements are met,
            check your Rewards History or contact us at {{ email }}.<br /><br />
            <span class="font3">6. Review Points</span>
            <br /><br />
            Review points are awarded only to verified buyer reviews. To earn
            review points, you must have:<br /><br />
            Purchased the product you are trying to review; and<br />
            · Received a review request email from
            {{ companyName }}.<br /><br />
            Points will not be awarded if you tried adding a review to a product
            that isn't part of your order history.<br /><br />
            If you review more than one product at once, you will only receive
            review points for one product. A minimum of four days must pass
            between your reviews in order for you to receive reward points for
            each of them.<br /><br />

            and promptly contact {{ companyName }}’s Customer Service (contact

            the delivery, the Customer or the person authorized to receive the
            order must promptly contact {{ companyName }}’s Customer Service.<br /><br />

            Any damage or anomaly must be reported to Customer Service until 5
            working days after the receipt. Customer Service will conduct a
            thorough analysis of the issue reported. In the event that Customer
            Service concludes that the damage or anomaly was {{ companyName }}’s
            or the carrier’s fault, {{ companyName }} will replace the
            defective/damaged items by sending a new shipment OR refund the
            amount spent on the items with anomalies, according to the
            customer’s best intents.<br /><br />

            <span class="font3">6. Delivery Times and Delays</span><br /><br />

            alter during promotional campaigns, sales, or other. If the delivery
            times are not met, Customer may contact Customer Service. Customer

            at most 30 days after the conclusion of the agreement in accordance
            with paragraph 9.2. If {{ companyName }} is unable to deliver the
            order within this timeframe, due to unavailability of the products,
            we will inform the Customer of such and fully reimburse you within
            30 days of such unavailability.

          <h3 class="mb-2">Returns and Exchanges</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The Customer may request a return within 14 days of the receipt of
            the order by the Customer or an authorized person.<br /><br />

            This right is excluded for products not suitable for return due to
            health protection or hygiene reasons and which were unsealed after
            delivery. All products unsuitable for return are clearly signaled
            and, in case your order contemplates one of these products,

            To request a return, Customer must enter the {{ companyName }}’s
            returns portal (available on the website) so
            {{ companyName }} acknowledges the return request and provides a
            return label, if the service available on the customer’s country.<br /><br />

            {{ companyName }} may not be able to provide return labels for the
            customer’s location - in that event, the customer must still
            register the return on the merchant’s returns platform and ship the
            item back (at his/her own expense) to the provided returns address
            (return address is provided to the customer when requesting a return
            on {{ companyName }}’s return platform).<br /><br />

            Products must be in their original condition in order for
            {{ companyName }} to accept the return. If the return is accepted,
            customer will be reimbursed of all payments made within 14 days,
            with exception of the delivery costs, described in paragraph 9.4.
            Refunds will be made through the same payment method used in the
            purchase.<br /><br />

            Products must be returned in conditions suitable for resale, that
            is, products must be in good condition accompanied by their original
            packaging, accessories, manuals and any other materials, at the
            latest within 14 days from the following day on the date of receipt
            of the order.<br /><br />

            Returns of products sent after this date will not be accepted.
